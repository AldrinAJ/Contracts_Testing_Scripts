==== Integer Underflow ====
SWC ID: 101
Severity: High
Contract: Alice
Function name: transfer(address,uint256)
PC address: 422
Estimated Gas Usage: 7837 - 62919
The binary subtraction can underflow.
The operands of the subtraction operation are not sufficiently constrained. The subtraction could therefore result in an integer underflow. Prevent the underflow by checking inputs or ensure sure that the underflow is caught by an assertion.

==== State change after external call ====
SWC ID: 107

Persistent state write after call
The contract account state is changed after an external call to a fixed address. Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place
